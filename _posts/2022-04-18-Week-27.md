As this short week comes to an end, let’s look back to the things we have learned. 


This week was cut short due to the *Holy week* holidays in Mexico, so while there’s not a lot to talk about, that doesn’t mean that which there is isn’t important. This week kicked off with my first *sprint review* for the project I’m currently working in, which was the first time I took part in this exercise in a professional manner. While I had already taken part in a team project in which we discussed and divided our work for the following period, mainly during the second phase of the apprenticeship, seeing the process in a more organized manner and taking part in it with a group of more experienced developers was certainly quite an experience, as well as a very good point of reference for the things we did right and wrong back then. 


After the formal review of the sprint and the discussion of which people would work on which tickets, some further discussions with my fellow apprentices followed in order to coordinate our efforts and ensure everyone got as clear as possible a picture of the situation and work to be done. While not part of the formal process of a sprint review, I found it especially helpful right now, as the lot of us are just getting used to the dynamic of this new team, and being able to rely on people in a similar situation to yours is both helpful and reassuring. 


The rest of the week I focused on working on the assigned tickets, mainly focusing on the React frontend in order to get a better picture of this part of the project. I must say, working on the frontend after being in the backend for a while is quite refreshing, perhaps because of personal preference, perhaps because of being more comfortable due to more experience with it. 


That was all of this week, not much to report, but thrilled to be back and filled with energy for this following week!
