With another week out of the door, it is now the moment to reflect back to last week. 


Last week was one of adjustment mainly, with the tasks divided for the current sprint, everyone had a grasp of which tasks had to be done, what the problems related to each of these tasks was, and the overall objective of the sprint. This week’s takeaways were therefore directed more towards the knowledge and experience of being part of an agile team rather than any specific technology or technique, as this was my first complete week being settled in with the project and team, without having to setup anything or going out for the week.  


With that said, I feel the main lesson from this week was that of starting to get accustomed to the rhythm of working in a project. The responsibility of having everything in order in time for the end of the sprint, knowing when to dig harder to find an answer on your own and when to reach out for help, how to lend a helping hand to my other teammates, effectively keeping track of the daily progress each member of the team has made, effectively analyzing and reassessing what is needed to reach the goal in a satisfactory manner... all of this I feel is rather something that comes with experience, second-hand knowledge one gets the more we work in these activities, and while I feel I still have a lot to improve and adjust, it is very encouraging to see the progress I’ve made in only a few couple weeks. Tomorrow the sprint ends, and I’ll see how this all closes out. I hope to get more comfortable with both the backend and frontend technologies, and also to be able to be more and more efficient with time. 


To finish up, a bit of a side note, as this wasn’t really anything I needed for a project or anything. This weekend I was bored and had some free time, so I looked around Hackerrank to find something to kill some time. I ended up finding the [Ruby](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ruby) problem list and started doing a couple of them, finding out that they were incredibly easy and fun to follow. Long story short, I [completed](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6924161873479159808/) the whole list, even though I had no real reason to study Ruby other than having some free time and letting myself go. It was really fun, I learned about *enums, hashes, methods, procs, lambas, lazy evaluation, each*, and much more. I don’t think I could jump into a Ruby project only with what I learned there, but at least I’ll be a lot more prepared!  


We’ll see what this week has in store.
